## About me ##
My main goal is to change my job. My current job has become monotonous and my career growth has stopped. Programming makes it possible to express themselves and create products for millions users. I like to see the result on the screen, so I chose the frontend. While studying at school, I would like to master the necessary skills for modern website development. Already learning to use and study javascript. I strive to learn everything new and it is interesting to me.
